    "Step-by-step implementation plan\n",
    "Phase 1: Schema and data readiness\n",
    "- Add tables: transaction_calculations, partner_calculations.\n",
    "- Add field: transactions.buyer_is_member.\n",
    "- Ensure references: partners.user_id → users.id; keep partner list consistent per transaction.\n",
    "Phase 2: Backend service (Node.js or PHP)\n",
    "- Create a calculation job/service:\n",
    "- Input: transaction_id (or run nightly for all “confirmed” transactions without calculations).\n",
    "- Fetch: transaction + its partners + buyer membership + profit/fee.\n",
    "- Compute: all fields outlined above.\n",
    "- Insert: one row into transaction_calculations; one row per partner into partner_calculations.\n",
    "- Update wallets (optional now, recommended later):\n",
    "- Seller wallet += seller_profit\n",
    "- Buyer wallet += buyer_credit (if purchase credit, you can track credit-type in an additional ledger table)\n",
    "- Partner wallet += partner_credit\n",
    "- Idempotency: Ensure you don’t duplicate inserts; either upsert (replace) or check if a calculation already exists.\n",
    "Phase 3: Front-end integration\n",
    "- Transaction detail page (admin/seller):\n",
    "- Show calculation snapshot from transaction_calculations (net, distributions).\n",
    "- Show per-partner table from partner_calculations.\n",
    "- Profile menu aggregation:\n",
    "- Seller: total seller_profit, recent transactions, wallet balance.\n",
    "- Partner: recent partner_credits, deal counts, wallet balance.\n",
    "- Buyer: buyer_credit history and wallet balance.\n",
    "- Excel export:\n",
    "- Allow export of transaction calculations and partner breakdowns per date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data consistency and audit\n",
    "- Logs: Write a log entry when calculations are generated or updated: user, action (“calculate_transaction”), transaction_id, summary.\n",
    "- Snapshots: Storing buyer_is_member at transaction time ensures historical accuracy if membership changes later.\n",
    "- Idempotent processing: Use a unique index on partner_calculations(transaction_id, partner_id) and transaction_calculations(transaction_id).\n",
    "```\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE partner_calculations\n",
    "  ADD UNIQUE KEY uniq_tx_partner (transaction_id, partner_id);\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE transaction_calculations\n",
    "  ADD UNIQUE KEY uniq_tx (transaction_id);\n",

    "Minimal API endpoints to wire this up\n",
    "- POST /api/transactions/:id/calculate\n",
    "- Body: none (or override flags)\n",
    "- Action: run calculation and persist rows\n",
    "- Returns: transaction_calculations + partner_calculations snapshot\n",
    "- GET /api/transactions/:id/calculations\n",
    "- Returns the computed data for display\n",
    "- GET /api/partners/:id/calculations\n",
    "- Returns partner’s historical credits\n",
    "- POST /api/wallets/apply-credits\n",
    "- Applies pending credits to wallets (if you separate ledger from balance updates)\n"

    "⚙️ Step 2: Set Up the Backend\n",
    "- Choose your backend stack (Node.js + Express is my recommendation for you).\n",
    "- Create models for each table (users, products, transactions, etc.).\n",
    "- Implement authentication (login with phone + password, hashed).\n",
    "- Add middleware for role checks (query user_roles to enforce permissions).\n",
    "\n",
    "📂 Step 3: Core APIs\n",
    "Build REST endpoints for the main flows:\n",
    "- Users: register, login, assign roles.\n",
    "- Products: add, update, import from Excel.\n",
    "- Transactions: create, confirm, list.\n",
    "- Calculations: run transaction + partner calculations.\n",
    "- Wallets: credit/debit, view balance.\n",
    "- Logs: record every action.\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 Step 4: Calculation Engine\n",
    "- Implement the calculation logic we documented:\n",
    "- Net profit, seller profit, buyer credit, partner shares, dev/team shares.\n",
    "- Write a service function that:\n",
    "- Reads a transaction.\n",
    "- Computes all values.\n",
    "- Inserts into transaction_calculations and partner_calculations.\n",
    "- Updates wallets.\n",
    "- Logs the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "🖥 Step 5: Frontend Integration\n",
    "- Add profile pages that aggregate:\n",
    "- User info (from users + profiles).\n",
    "- Wallet balance.\n",
    "- Products owned.\n",
    "- Transactions and calculations.\n",
    "- Sellers: Excel upload panel.\n",
    "- Buyers: transaction history + credits.\n",
    "- Partners: deal index + share history.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Step 6: Testing\n",
    "- Unit test each function (especially calculations).\n",
    "- Test Excel import/export with sample files.\n",
    "- Test role enforcement (seller can’t edit another seller’s products).\n",
    "- Test wallet updates are atomic.\n"
